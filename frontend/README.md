### NOTE - on tools used (Create react app)
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). I read the instructions and noticed how any types of frameworks/tools were permitted so I decided to bootstrap this project with CRA.

All in all, the biggest reason I'm using it is because it saves time by allowing me to not focus or spend time on setting up a build environment. In and of itself the build process wont make the application work or break, but it save me time but not worrying about:

- Babel (es6 on browsers)
- Live reload
- bundling
